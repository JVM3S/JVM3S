Welcome to the edge of the internet!

## Whoami

I am James (aka. Hideo). I am a high-schooler in Aichi, Japan. I am an aspiring coder, with projects from C to Dart.

I also have an avid passion in photography and cycling. I mainly do landscape astrophotograpy, so I cycle far in the night chasing "the shot."
